# PosturePerfect - TAMUhack 2026 Hardware Track

- Using ultrasonic distance sensors, our device is able to detect and warn the user of bad posture. With one sensor measuring the distance between your neck and the chair, and the other measuring the shoulder to the chair, the posture device is able to give an audio warning if the shoulder distance is greater than the spine distance.

Components: 
Arduino, resistor(220 ohms), passive buzzer, ultrasonic distance sensors, wires, and a battery
